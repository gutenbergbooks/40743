<h3>
<span>THE OLD COUNTESS OF DESMOND.<br />
(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. iv., p. 426.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I feel much obliged to J. H. M., who writes from Bath, and has directed
my attention to Horace Walpole's "minute inquiry" respecting the "Old
Countess of Desmond," as also to "Pennant's Tours," all which I have had
opportunity of examining since I wrote to you last. The references do
not incline me to alter one word of the opinion I have ventured as to
the identity of this lady; on the contrary, with the utmost respect for
his name and services to the cause of antiquarian research, I propose to
show that Horace Walpole (whose interest in the question was, by his own
confession, but incidental, and ancillary to his historic inquiries into
the case of Richard III., and who had no direct data to go on) knew
nothing of the matter, and was quite mistaken as to the individual.</p>

<p>Before I proceed on this daring undertaking, I beg to say, that an
inspection of Pennant's print, called "The Old Countess of Desmond,"
<i>satisfies</i> me that it is <i>not</i> taken from a duplicate picture of that
in possession of the Knight of Kerry: though there certainly is a
resemblance in the faces of the two portraits, yet the differences are
many and decisive. Pennant says that there are "four other pictures in
Great Britain in the same dress, and without any difference of feature,"
besides that at Dupplin Castle, from which his print was copied; but
that of the Knight of Kerry must be reckoned as a sixth portrait, taken
at a <i>much more advanced period</i> of life: in it the wrinkles and
features denote <i>extreme</i> old age. The head-dresses are markedly
different, that of Pennant being a <i>cloth</i> hood lying back from the face
in folds; in the Knight of Kerry's, the head-dress is more like a beaver
bonnet standing forward from the head, and throwing the face somewhat
into shade. In Pennant's, the cloak is plainly fastened by leathern
strap, somewhat after the manner of a laced shoe; in the other, the
fastening is a single button: but the difference most marked is this,
that the persons originally sitting for these pictures, looked opposite
ways, and, of course, presented different sides to the painter. So that,
in Pennant's plate, the <i>right side-face</i> is forward; and in the other,
the left: therefore, these pictures are markedly and manifestly neither
the same, nor copies either of the other.</p>

<p>It does not concern us, in order to maintain the authority of our
<i>Irish</i> picture, to follow up the question at issue between Pennant and
Walpole<a id="Page_146"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[146]</span> but I may here observe, that either must be wrong in an
important matter of fact. Walpole, in a note to his "Fugitive Pieces"
(Lord Orford's <i>Works</i>, vol. i. p. 210-17.), writes thus: "<i>Having by
permission of the Lord Chamberlain obtained a copy of the picture at
Windsor Castle, called The Countess of Desmond, I discovered that it is
not her portrait; on the back is written in an old hand, 'The Mother of
Rembrandt.'</i>" He then proceeds to prove the identity of this picture
with one given to King Charles I. by Sir Robert Car, "My Lord Ankrom"
(after Duke of Roxburg), and set down in the Windsor Catalogue as
"<i>Portrait of an old woman, with a great scarf on her head, by
Rembrandt</i>." Pennant's note differs from this in an essential
particular; he mentions this picture at Windsor Castle thus: "<i>This was
a present from Sir Robert Car, Earl of Roxburg, as is signified on the
back; above it is written with a pen,</i> 'R<span class="smcap lowercase">EMBRANDT</span>' (not a word of his
<i>mother</i>), <i>which must be a mistake, for Rembrandt was not fourteen
years of age in 1614</i>, at a time when <i>it is certain (?) that the
Countess was not living, and ... it does not appear that he ever visited
England</i>."</p>

<p>The discrepancy of these two accounts is obvious&mdash;if it "<i>be written in
an old hand, 'The Mother of Rembrandt,'</i>" on the back of the picture, it
seems strange that Pennant should <i>omit</i> the first three words; if they
be not so written, it seems equally strange that Walpole should venture
to <i>add</i> them. I presume the picture at Windsor is still extant; and
probably some reader of "N. &amp; Q." having access to it, will be so good
as to settle the question of accuracy and veracity between two
gentlemen, of whom one must be guilty of <i>suppressio veri</i>, or the other
of <i>suggestio falsi</i>.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole, or his editor, must have corrected his "Fugitive Pieces"
since the "Strawberry Hill edition," to which J. H. M. refers, was
printed; for in the edition I have consulted, instead of saying "I can
make no sense of the word <i>noie</i>," the meaning is correctly given in a
foot-note to the inscription; and the passage given by J. H. M. is
altogether omitted from the text.</p>

<p>I must now proceed in my bold attempt to show that Horace Walpole knew
nothing of a matter, into which he made a "minute inquiry." This may
seem presumptuous in a tyro towards one of the old masters of
antiquarian lore and research; but I plead in apology the great advance
of the science since Horace Walpole's days, and the greater plenty of
materials for forming or correcting a judgement. It has been well said,
that a single chapter of Mr. Charles Knight's <i>Old England</i> would full
furnish and set up an antiquarian of the last century; and this is true,
such and so many are the advantages for obtaining information, which we
modern antiquaries possess over those who are gone before us; and
lastly, to quote old Fuller's quaintness, I would say that "a dwarf on a
giant's shoulders can see farther than he who carries him:" thus do I
explain and excuse my attempt to impugn the conclusion of Horace
Walpole.</p>

<p>Walpole's first conjectures applied to a Countess of Desmond, whose tomb
is at Sligo in Ireland, and who was widow to that <i>Gerald</i>, the
sixteenth earl, <i>ingens rebellibus exemplar</i>, who was outlawed, and
killed in the wood of <i>Glanagynty</i>, in the county of Kerry,
 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1583.
Walpole applied to an Irish correspondent for copies of the inscriptions
on her tomb; but we need not follow or discuss the supposition of her
identity with "the old Countess" further, for he himself abandons it,
and writes to his Irish correspondent thus:&mdash;"<i>The inscriptions you have
sent me have not cleared away the difficulties relating to the Countess
of Desmond; on the contrary, they make me doubt whether the lady
interred at Sligo was the person reported to have lived to such an
immense age.</i>"</p>

<p>Well might he doubt it, for in no one particular could they be
identified: <i>e.g.</i> the lady buried at Sligo made her will in 1636, and
survived to 1656,&mdash;a date long beyond the latest assigned for the demise
of "the old Countess." Sir Walter Raleigh expressly says, "the old
Countess had <i>held her jointure from all the Earls of Desmond since the
time of Edward IV.</i>," a description which could not apply to the widow
of a person who did not die until 1583, in the reign of Elizabeth. There
are many other <i>impossibilities</i> in the case, discussed by Walpole, into
which it is unnecessary to follow him.</p>

<p>Walpole then reverts to the issue of Thomas, the sixth Earl of Desmond,
who was compelled to surrender his earldom, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1418, for making an
"inferior marriage;" and conjectures that "the old Countess" might have
been the wife of a grandson of his born 1452, or thereabouts, who would
be, as Walpole states, "a titular earl:" but this absurd supposition is
met by the fact of our "old Countess" enjoying a jointure from all the
earls <i>de facto</i> in another line; a provision which the widow of an
adverse claimant to the earldom could hardly have made good.</p>

<p>Walpole's last conjecture, following the suggestion of Smith's <i>History
of Cork</i>, fixes on the widow of Thomas (<i>the twelfth earl</i>, according to
the careful pedigree of Sir William Betham, though Smith erroneously
calls him the thirteenth earl), and asserts the identity of the "old
Countess" with a <i>second</i> wife, called "Catherine Fitzgerald of Dromana"
(the Dacres branch of the Geraldines): for this assertion Smith, in a
footnote, quotes "the Russel MSS.," and Walpole calls this "the most
positive evidence we have." Of the MSS. referred to, I can find no
further trace, and this "positive evidence" is weakened by the silence
of Lodge's <i>Peerage</i> as to any<a id="Page_147"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[147]</span> second marriage of the earl in
question, while, on the contrary, he gives many probabilities against
it. Thomas (moyle, or bald), twelfth earl, succeeded to his nephew,
James, the eleventh earl, in 1529, being then in extreme age, and died
in five years after; he was the second brother of James, ninth earl,
murdered in 1587&mdash;whose widow I affirm the old Countess to have been.
Let us not lose sight of the fact, that the "old Countess," by general
consent, was married in the reign of Edward IV., who died 1483. And I
would ask, what probability is there that a younger brother would be
already married to a <i>second wife</i>, in the lifetime of his elder
brother, who is described as murdered "while flourishing in wealth and
power at the age of twenty-nine years?" The supposition carries
improbability on the face of it; none of the genealogies mention this
second marriage at all; and Dr. Smith, whose county histories I have had
particular occasion to examine, was, though a diligent collector of
<i>reports</i>, no antiquarian authority to rely on. Above all, it is to be
remembered, that Sir Walter Raleigh calls her "<i>The old Countess of
Desmond of</i> I<span class="smcap lowercase">NCHEQUIN</span>:" this is in itself proof, all but positive, that
the lady was an <i>O'Bryen</i>, for none other could have "part or lot" in
the hereditary designation of that family: hence I have no hesitation in
adhering to the conclusion, which, with slight correction of dates, I
have adopted from accurate authorities, that "M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARGARET</span> O'<span class="smcap lowercase">BRIEN</span>, WIFE OF
JAMES, NINTH EARL OF DESMOND, WHO WAS MURDERED IN 1587, WAS THE GENUINE
AND ONLY 'OLD COUNTESS.'" Upon the only point on which I venture to
correct my authority, namely, as to the date of the earl's death, I
find, on reference to an older authority than any to which we have
hitherto referred, that my emendation is confirmed. In the Annals of the
Four Masters, compiled from more ancient documents still, in the year
1636, I find, under the date 1487, the following: "The Earl of Desmond,
James Fitzgerald, was treacherously killed by his own people at
Rathgeola (Rathkeale, co. Limerick), at the instigation of his brother
John."</p>

<h3>
<span>THE IMPERIAL EAGLE OF FRANCE.</span>
</h3>

<p>On reading the <i>Times</i> of the 7th ult. at our city library, in which the
following translation of a paragraph in the French journal, <i>Le
Constitutionnel</i>, appeared, application was made to me for an
explanation of that part where the Emperor Napoleon is represented as
stating, among other advantages of preferring an eagle to a cock as the
national emblem or ensign, which, during the ancient dynasty of France,
the latter had been&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>that it owes its origin to a pun.</i> I will not have the cock,
   said the Emperor; it lives on the dunghill, and allows itself to
   have its throat twisted by the fox. I will take the eagle, which
   bears the thunderbolt, and which can gaze on the sun. The French
   eagles shall make themselves respected, like the Roman eagles.
   The cock, besides, has the disadvantage of owing its origin to a
   pun," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Premising that the French journalist's object is to authorise the
present ruler of France's similar adoption and restoration of the noble
bird on the French standard by the example of his uncle, I briefly
stated the circumstance to which Napoleon, on this occasion, referred;
and as not unsuited, I should think, to your miscellany, I beg leave to
repeat it here.</p>

<p>In 1545, during the sitting of the Council of Trent, Peter Danes, one of
the most eminent ecclesiastics of France, who had been professor of
Greek, and filled several other consonant stations, appeared at the
memorable council as one of the French representatives. While there, his
colleague, Nicholas Pseaume, Bishop of Verdun, in a vehement oration,
denounced the relaxed discipline of the Italians, when Sebastian Vancius
de Arimino (so named in the "Canones et Decreta" of the Council), Bishop
of Orvietto (Urbevetanus), sneeringly exclaimed "Gallus cantat,"
dwelling on the double sense of the word Gallus&mdash;a Frenchman or a cock,
and intending to express "the cock crows;" to which Danes promptly and
pointedly responded, "Utinam et Galli cantum Petrus resipisceret," which
excited, as it deserved, the general applause of the assembly, thus
turning the insult into a triumph. The apt allusion will be made clear
by a reference to the words of the Gospels: St. Matthew, xxvi. 75.; St.
Mark, xiv. 68. 72.; St. Luke, xxii. 61-2.; and St. John, xviii. 27.,
where the <span title="[Greek: alektorophônia]">&#7936;&#955;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#969;&#957;&#8055;&#945;</span> of the original is the "cantus galli"
of the Vulgate, and where Petrus represents the pope, who is aroused to
<i>resipiscere</i> by the example of his predecessor St. Peter.</p>

<p>This incident in the memorable assembly is adverted to in the French
contemporary letters and memoirs, but more particularly in the
subsequent publication of a learned member of Danes's family, <i>La Vie,
Eloges et Opuscules de Pierre Danes, par P. Hilaire Danes</i>, Paris, 1731,
4to., with the the portrait of the Tridentine deputy, who became Bishop
of Lavaur, in Languedoc (now département du Saone), and preceptor to
Francis, the short-lived husband of Mary Stuart, before that prince's
ascent to the throne. So high altogether was he held in public
estimation, that he was supposed well entitled to the laudatory anagram
formed of his name (Petrus Danesius), "De superis natus."</p>

<p>In the Council of Trent there only appeared two Englishmen, Cardinal
Pole and Francis Gadwell,<a id="well1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Bishop of St. Asaph, with three Irish
prelates, (1) Thomas Herliky, Bishop of Ross, called<a id="Page_148"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[148]</span> Thomas
Overlaithe in the records of the Council; (2) Eugenius O'Harte, there
named Ohairte, a Dominican friar, Bishop of Ardagh; and (3) Donagh
MacCongal, Bishop of Raphoe: Sir James Ware adds a fourth, Robert
Waucup, or Vincentius, of whom, however, I find no mention in the
official catalogue of the assisting prelates. Deprived of sight,
according to Ware, from his childhood, he yet made such proficiency in
learning, that, after attaining the high degree of Doctor of Sorbonne in
France, he was appointed Archbishop of Armagh, or Primate of Ireland;
but of this arch-see he never took possession, it being held by a
<i>reformed</i> occupant, Dr. George Dowdall, appointed by Henry VIII. in
1543.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Bee Superstitions&mdash;Blessing Apple-trees&mdash;"A Neck! a Neck!"</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The
superstition concerning the bees is common among the smaller farmers in
the rural districts of Devon. I once knew an apprentice boy <i>sent back</i>
from the funeral <i>cortège</i> by the nurse, to tell the bees of it, as it
had been forgotten. They usually put some wine and honey for them before
the hives on that day. A man whose ideas have been confused frequently
says his "head has been among the bees" (buzzing).</p>

<p>The custom is still very prevalent in Devonshire of "hollowing to the
apple-trees" on Old Christmas Eve. Toasted bread and sugar is soaked in
new cider made hot for the farmer's family, and the boys take some out
to pour on the oldest tree, and sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Here's to thee,</p>
      <p>Old apple-tree,</p>
      <p>From every bough</p>
    <p>  Give apples enough,</p>
      <p>Hat fulls, cap fulls</p>
    <p>  Bushel, bushel boss fulls.</p>
           <p> Hurrah, hurrah!"</p>

</div>

<p>The village boys go round also for the purpose, and get some halfpence
given them for their "hollering," as they call it. I believe this to be
derived from a Pagan custom of offering to Ceres.</p>

<p>The farmer's men have also a custom, on cutting the last sheaf of wheat
on the farm, of shouting out "A neck! a neck!" as they select a handful
of the finest ears of corn, which they bind up, and plait the straw of
it, often very prettily, which they present to the master, who hangs it
up in the farm kitchen till the following harvest. I do not know whence
this custom arises.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTE ON THE COINS OF VABALATHUS.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 255. 427. 491.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Since the publication of my last note on the coins of Vabalathus, I have
obtained the <i>Lettres Numismatiques</i> du Baron Marchant, 1850. The
original edition being very rare, and I believe only three hundred of
this one having been printed, I have thought it might be as well to
record some additional information from it in your pages. Marchant
reads, "Vabalathus Verenda Concessione Romanorum Imperatore Medis datus
Rex." It is needless to remark on this, further than on the more ancient
interpretations. He points out that the Greek letters, or rather
numerals, show the coins to have been struck in a country where Greek,
if not the popular language, was that of the government, along with
Latin. This country was necessarily an Oriental one, and I think this
observation would rather lead to the inference that the word
 V<span class="smcap lowercase">CRIMDR</span>,
occupying the place usually filled by Cæsar, Augustus, <span title="[Greek: SEBASÔS]">&#1017;&#917;&#914;&#913;&#1017;&#937;&#1017;</span>,
&amp;c., might be an Oriental title, though expressed in Latin letters.
Millin, to whom he had communicated his view, thought correctly "que
ça<a id="Page_149"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[149]</span> sentait un peu le père Harduin," and it was only published in
the posthumous edition of his works. De Gauley has published coins
struck by the Arabs in Africa, which have Latin legends, in some of
which the Arabic titles are given in Latin letters. The Emir Musa Ben
Nasir appears thus, M&#965;SE. F. NASIR. AMIRA. The coins of Vabalathus offer
a more ancient example of the same. I have given what appears to me the
clue, and I hope it will be followed out by Orientalists. M. de
Longperier, in his annotations to the 28th letter, shows that the name
<span title="[Greek: Athênas]">&#7944;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#8118;&#962;</span> is derived from
 <span title="[Greek: Athênodôros]">&#7944;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#8057;&#948;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, and appears to
think
 <span title="[Greek: ATHÊNOY]">&#913;&#920;&#919;&#925;&#927;&#933;</span> or
 <span title="[Greek: ATHÊNY]">&#913;&#920;&#919;&#925;&#933;</span> the genitive of
 <span title="[Greek: ATHÊNAS]">&#913;&#920;&#919;&#925;&#913;&#1017;</span>. The difficulty, he says, is, that names in
 <span title="[Greek: as]">&#8118;&#962;</span> have,
in the Alexandrian dialect, the genitive
 <span title="[Greek: atos]">&#8118;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>. He does not
appear to have noticed the reading as
 <span title="[Greek: HUIoS]">&#933;&#921;&#959;&#1017; </span> (or
 <span title="[Greek: OU]">&#927;&#933;</span> as
 <span title="[Greek: HO HUIoS]">&#927; &#933;&#921;&#959;&#1017;</span>?), which appears to me to remove the difficulty, but
also to obviate the necessity of the name
 <span title="[Greek: Athênas]">&#7944;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#8118;&#962;</span> at all. He
remarks on the similarity of name between
 <span title="[Greek: Athênas]">&#913;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span>,
 <span title="[Greek: Athênatos]">&#913;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, and Odenathus.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"If," he says, "we examine comparatively Vabalath
 (<span title="[Greek: OUABALATH]">&#927;&#933;&#913;&#914;&#913;&#923;&#913;&#920;</span>) and Odenath, or rather Odanath, as in Zosimus, we see
   an analogous formation; Ou-baalat, Ou-tanat, the feminine of Baal
   or Bel, and of Tan, Dan, or Zan, preceded by the same syllable.
   Baalat is a Scripture form (Jos. xix. 44.; 1 Kings ix. 48.;
   Paral. ii. viii. 6.). De Gauley has found the name of Tanat in a
   Ph&oelig;nician inscription, and Lenormant remarks that this
   feminine form of Zan, or Jupiter, corresponds to Athéné. Thus
   Ou-tanat is the equivalent of Athenas, consequently of
   Athenodorus."</p>

<p>Vabalathus is thus, if these etymological considerations be correct, the
son of Odenathus. Longperier proposes to read
<span title="[Greek: ERÔTAS]">&#917;&#929;&#937;&#932;&#913;&#1017;</span> for
<span title="[Greek: SRÔIAS]">&#1017;&#929;&#937;&#921;&#913;&#1017;</span>, and to consider this the equivalent of Herodes,
mentioned by Trebellius Pollio. With all deference to M. de Longperier,
I venture to oppose the following objections. First, Some coins read
<span title="[Greek: SRIAS]">&#1017;&#929;&#921;&#913;&#1017;</span>, which would read
<span title="[Greek: ERTAS]">&#917;&#929;&#932;&#913;&#1017;</span> on his principle. Since,
in the coins of Zenobia, Vabalathus, and those bearing the name of
Athenodorus, whether struck by Vabalathus or not, is not material at
present, we find the names at full length, not omitting the vowels, it
is natural to suppose that the same would here take place, if the word
really were the name of Herodes. To explain, if we found
 <span title="[Greek: ZÊNOBIA]">&#918;&#919;&#925;&#927;&#914;&#921;&#913;</span> and
 <span title="[Greek: ZNOBIA]">&#918;&#925;&#927;&#914;&#921;&#913;</span>,
 <span title="[Greek: ATHÊNODÔROS]">&#913;&#920;&#919;&#925;&#927;&#916;&#937;&#929;&#927;&#1017;</span> and
 <span title="[Greek: ATHNDROS]">&#913;&#920;&#925;&#916;&#929;&#927;&#1017;</span>, or similar contractions, we might consider
 <span title="[Greek: ERÔTAS]">&#917;&#929;&#937;&#932;&#913;&#1017;</span>
and
 <span title="[Greek: ERTAS]">&#917;&#929;&#932;&#913;&#1017;</span> identical. Secondly, On my specimens of this coin I
find the
 <span title="[Greek: i]">&#953;</span> in this word distinctly formed, and the
 <span title="[Greek: T]">&#932;</span>
in the next word
 <span title="[Greek: AUT]">&#913;&#933;&#932;</span> <i>as</i> distinct. All authors have read this
letter
 <span title="[Greek: i]">&#953;</span>, although varying in the rest. Thirdly, On the obverse
of these specimens the
 <span title="[Greek: E]">&#917;</span> is larger and more open than the
 <span title="[Greek: S]">&#1017;</span>, as may be seen in the conclusion
 <span title="[Greek: ...NOS . SEB]">...&#925;&#927;&#1017; . &#1017;&#917;&#914;</span>, where it is preceded by two sigmas, and is easy to compare with
them. We should naturally expect to find it having the same form on the
reverse, if the reading
 <span title="[Greek: ERÔTAS]">&#917;&#929;&#937;&#932;&#913;&#1017;</span> were correct. But it is of the
same size as the other letters, on my specimens at least. I need not say
that there is no trace of the central stroke.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE AGNOMEN OF "BROTHER JONATHAN," OF MASONIC ORIGIN.</span>
</h3>

<p>George Washington, commander-in-chief of the American army in the
revolution, was a mason, as were all the other generals, with the
solitary exception of Arnold the traitor, who attempted to deliver West
Point, a most important position, into the hands of the enemy. It was
this treasonable act on the part of Arnold which caused the gallant
Andre's death, and ultimately placed a monument over his remains in
Westminster Abbey. On one occasion, when the American army had met with
some serious reverses, General Washington called his <i>brother officers</i>
together, to consult in what manner their effects could be the best
counteracted. Differing as they did in opinion, the commander-in-chief
postponed any action on the subject, by remarking, "Let us consult
brother Jonathan," referring to Jonathan Trumbull, who was a well-known
mason, and particularly distinguished "for his sound judgment, strict
morals, and having the tongue of good report."</p>

<p>George Washington was initiated a mason in Fredericksburg, Virginia,
Lodge No. 4, on the 4th of November, 1752, was passed a fellow craft on
the 3rd of March, 1753, and raised to the sublime degree of a master
mason on the 4th day of August, 1753. The hundredth anniversary of this
distinguished mason's initiation is to be celebrated in America
throughout the length and breadth of the land.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Hippopotamus, Behemoth.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The young animal which has drawn so much
attention hitherto, will increase in attractiveness as he acquires his
voice, for which the zoologist may now <i>arectis auribus</i> await the
development. It has appeared singular to many who knew the Greek name of
this animal to signify <i>river-horse</i>, that he should be so unlike a
horse. Nevertheless, the Greeks who knew him only at a distance, as we
did formerly, named him from his voice and ears after an animal which he
so little resembles in other respects. The Egyptian words from which the
Behemoth of Job (chap. xl. v. 10.) are derived, more fitly designate him
as <i>water-ox</i>, <i>B-ehe-mo&#363;t</i> = literatim, <i>the aquatic ox</i>.</p>

<span><i>Coins of Edward III. struck at Antwerp in 1337.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Ruding, in his
<i>Annals of the Coinage of Great Britain</i> (3rd ed. p. 212.), describing
the coins of Edward III. (who often resided on the Continent, and whose
sister Eleanor was married to Raimond III., Duke of Guelder), says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In November <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1337, according to Grafton, the king was made
   vicar-general and lieutenant to the emperor, <i>with power to coin
   money of gold and silver</i>. He kept his winter at the castle of
   Louvain, and caused great sums of money, both of gold and silver,
   to be coined at Antwerp."</p>


<p>And in the note:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Chronicle [of Grafton?] <i>sub anno</i>. Froissart also mentions this
   fact. The silver coins were probably struck with English dies,
   and consequently <i>are not now to be distinguished</i>."</p>

<p>Now, you will oblige me by informing your English readers, that though
these may have been struck with English dies, they can readily be
distinguished from other English coins by the legends. They are
represented on Pl. viii., Nos. 19. and 20., in my <i>Munten der voormalige
Hertogdommen Braband en Limburg, van de vroeyste Tijden tot aan de
Pacificatie van Gend</i>. The type is wholly English, and agrees with the
coins of Edward III., as I have remarked in the text. The <i>Moneta
nostra</i> indicates a joint coin (<i>i.e.</i> common to the emperor and to the
king); as Coin No. 3. Pl. xxxiii. was probably a joint coin of Edward
III. and Philip VI., King of France.</p>

<h3>
<span>ENGLISH FREE TOWNS.</span>
</h3>

<p>A great many of your readers are doubtless aware that there are in
France a number of towns commonly known by the name of <i>Villes
Anglaises</i>, or the English towns, and also called <i>Bastides</i>. Many of
these were certainly founded by Edward I., and important privileges were
granted to these <i>Free Towns</i> from motives of sound policy. These towns
are all built on a regular plan, the principal streets wide, open, and
straight, and crossing each other at right angles, with a large
market-place, usually in the centre of the town. I have seen several of

time. I could mention other peculiarities about them; but it is not

in England corresponding with them, of the same regular plan and
arrangement. The only one I have been able to hear of is the ruined town
of Winchelsea, which corresponds closely with them, and was also founded
by Edward I. If any of your readers can inform me of any other town in
England of the same plan, I shall be greatly obligated to them.</p>

<p>&mdash;A small edition of Bishop Hall's
<i>Resolutions and Decisions of Cases of Conscience</i>, printed in 1650, and
consequently in the author's lifetime, has, as its frontispiece, a "vera

<span><i>Mother Huff and Mother Damnable.</i></span>

<h4>
<span><i>Audley Family.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents inform me whether there
are any male representatives still existing of the family of <i>Audley</i>
(or <i>Awdeley</i>) of <i>Gransden</i>, in Huntingdonshire; or, if not, when it
became extinct?</p>

<p>Thomas Audley, created Lord Audley of Walden, Lord High Chancellor, and
K. G. by Henry VIII., had an only daughter and heiress, married to the
Duke of Norfolk. He had also two brothers, Robert and Henry. <i>Robert</i>
was of <i>Berechurch</i>, in Essex; and, on the chancellor's death without
male issue, inherited from him large landed property. His line
flourished for several generations, and ended in Henry Audley&mdash;a weak
and vicious spendthrift, who ruined himself, and died (without issue) in
the Fleet Prison, in 1714, having married a daughter of Philip, Viscount
Strangford. <i>Henry</i>, the chancellor's youngest brother, had the manor of
<i>Great Gransden</i>, in Huntingdonshire, by a grant from Henry VIII., where
his descendants were fixed for several generations. In the <i>Visitation
of Hunts</i>, made in 1613, under the authority of William Camden
(Clarencieux), there is a pedigree of the Audleys of Gransden, which
comes down to Robert Audley, married to Elizabeth, daughter of John
Marbury, who had two sons then living, <i>Robert</i> and <i>Francis</i>, of the
respective ages of three and two (in 1613): a daughter, <i>Elizabeth</i>, was
born in 1614, and married William Sneyd, Esq., of Keele, co. Stafford;
she had issue, and died 1686, aged seventy-two.</p>

<p>Gransden must have passed from the possession of that family not long
after this visitation; for, in Charles II.'s time, it belonged to Sir
Julius Cæsar: and in the catalogue of lords and gentlemen who compounded
for their estates (1655), the only Audleys of Hunts who were mentioned,
are, <i>Wheatehill Audley, of Woodhurst</i>; and <i>Molineux Audley, of St.
Ives</i> (both in Hunts). The parish registers of Gransden throw no light
on the fate of the family. The church contains no memorials, and local
tradition is silent.</p>

<p>Can any of your correspondents supply any information? My object is to
ascertain whether the above-mentioned <i>Elizabeth</i>, married to Wm. Sneyd,
did, or did not, become the representative of the family, by the death,
without issue, of her brothers.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Key Experiments.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can some one of your correspondents afford me an

forefinger of their opposite hands; the key should be tied in a thin
book, with the handle projecting so far that the finger may easily pass
between the book and the handle; the book serves to balance the key by
its weight, and exhibits more plainly any movement of the key; both
persons then wish the key to turn to the right or left, and, after a few
moments, the key will take the desired direction. The earnest and united
wish of the operators appears to be the motive power. The divination by
"the Bible and key," given in your Vol. i., p. 413., and Vol. ii., p.
5., is evidently based on the same principles; and the mention of that
superstition will be an apology for my making your pages the medium of
the present inquiry, which is perhaps scarcely fitted for a publication
designed for literary purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span>COVERDALE'S BIBLE.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 59., 109.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Learned disputes about the translation of Biblical words might occupy
the pages of "N. &amp; Q." to the discomfort of some of its readers. In fact
its numbers might be all swallowed up in the important inquiry after
those original texts which our eminent translators used when they
supplied England with the water of life, by furnishing the country with
a faithful translation of the Holy Oracles. To the martyr Tyndale, and
the venerable servant of Christ, Coverdale, this nation and the world
are indebted to an extent that no honour to their memory can ever repay.
Tyndale, fearless, learned, and devoted, was sacrificed in the prime of
life; while Coverdale, more cautious, went on to old age constantly
energetic in promoting the Reformation.</p>

<p>Words and sentences can be produced in which Coverdale claims
superiority over Tyndale. While Tyndale's is more suited to this day of
fearless enquiry and meridian light, Coverdale's may be preferred as a
gentler clearing away of the morning clouds which obscured the horizon
after Wickliffe had introduced the day spring from on high.</p>

<p>It has become too much the fashion in our day to exalt Tyndale at the
expense of Coverdale. This is ungenerous and unjust: they were both of
them great and shining lights in the hemisphere of the Reformation.
Tyndale's learning and decision of character gave him great advantages
as a translator from languages then but little known; while Coverdale's
cautious, pains-taking perseverance enabled him to render most essential
service to the sacred cause of Divine Truth. Our inquiry commenced with
the question, why the words "translated out of Douche and Latyn into
Englyshe" appeared upon the title-page to <i>some</i> copies of Coverdale's
Bible, 1535. I must remind my excellent friend, the Rev.
H<span class="smcap lowercase">ENRY</span> W<span class="smcap lowercase">ALTER</span>,
that while the copy in the British Museum, and that at Holkham, has
those words, a finer and unsophisticated copy in the library of Earl
Jersey of the <i>same</i> edition has no such words; and that the four
editions subsequently published by Coverdale all omit the words "Douche
and Latyn," and insert in their place, "faythfully translated in
English." My decided impression is, that the insertion of those words on
the first title-page was not with Coverdale's knowledge, and that, lest
they should mislead the reader, they were omitted when the title was
reprinted; and a dedication and prologue were added when the copies
arrived in England, the dedication and preface being from a very
different fount of type to that used in printing the text.</p>

<p>It must also be recollected that Coverdale altered his prologue to the
reader in the copies dedicated to Edward VI. Instead of "To helpe me
herein I have had sondrye translacyons, not onely in Latyn but also <i>of
the Douche interpreters</i>," the last four words are omitted, and he has
inserted, "in other languages." Coverdale, with indefatigable zeal, made
use of every translation in his power. Tyndale's <i>Pentateuch</i> had been
for several years published, and had passed through two editions. His
translation of <i>Jonah</i>, with a long prologue, was printed in 1530 and
1537, and republished in Matthew's (Tyndale's) Bible in 1549. The
prologue is inserted in <i>The Works of Tyndale</i>,<a id="Page_154"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[154]</span> <i>Frith, and
Barnes</i>, and the translation of <i>Jonah</i> by Tyndale is denounced by Sir
Thomas More. Why M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. W<span class="smcap lowercase">ALTER</span> doubts its existence I cannot imagine. The
title-page is given at full length by Herbert in his <i>Typographical
Antiquities</i>; and it is a fact that <i>Henry Walter</i>, in 1828, in his
<i>Second Letter to the Bishop of Peterborough</i>, clearly states that which
in 1852 he says is "adhuc sub judice." Coverdale rejected from the canon
all apocryphal chapters and books, and placed them together as a
distinct part, in four of his editions, between the Old and New
Testaments, and in one between Esther and Job. In this he neither copied
from the Latin nor the German.</p>

<p>No subject connected with English history has been more confused and
misrepresented than the history of the English Bible. Mr. Anderson's
errors in quotation are most remarkable,&mdash;a fact much to be regretted in
so laborious a compilation. In his selection of passages to prove the
superiority of Tyndale over Coverdale (<i>Annals</i>, vol. i. pp. 587, 588),
in copying forty-six lines he has made <i>two hundred and sixty-one
errors</i>; viz. 191 literal errors in spelling, 5 words omitted, 1 added,
2 words exchanged for others, 11 capitals put for small letters, 47
words in Italics which ought to be Roman, 3 words joined, and 1 divided.
These extracts ought to have been correct, for accurate reprints were
within his reach; it probably exhibits the most extraordinary number of
blunders in as short a space as could be found in the annals of
literature. Mr. Anderson is equally unfortunate in nearly all his
extracts from written documents and printed books: let one more instance
suffice. He quotes the just and memorable words of Dr. Geddes in eulogy
of our translations made in the reign of Henry VIII. It is astonishing
how little obsolete the language of it is, even at this day, and "in
point of perspicuity and noble simplicity, propriety of idiom, and
purity of style, no English version has yet surpassed it." To this
extract Mr. Anderson adds a note (vol. i. p. 586.): "These words are
applied by Geddes, by way of distinction, to Tyndale, and not to
Coverdale, as sometimes quoted." They occur in Dr. Geddes's <i>Prospectus
for a New Translation of the Holy Bible</i>, 4to. 1786, p. 88. His words
are: "The first compleat edition of an English version of the whole
Bible, from the originals, is that of Tyndale's and Coverdale's
together." It is to the united labours of these two great men that Dr.
Geddes applies his just, and, for a Roman Catholic, liberal eulogium.</p>

<p>Amidst a mass of errors Mr. Anderson complains, in a note on p. 569.,
that Lewis's <i>History of the English Bible</i> is "grievously in want of
correction!" Mr. Anderson's <i>Annals</i> are encumbered with a heavy
disquisition on the origin of printing, which reminds us of
Knickerbocker's <i>History of New York</i>, in which we find to a
considerable extent learned accounts of the cosmogony of creation,
because, if the world had not been created, in all probability New York
would not have existed: the same probability connects the origin of
printing with the history of the English Bible. Why the annalist should
have omitted any notice of those important Roman Catholic translations
at Rheims and Douay, after a long account of Wickliffe's, which was from
the same source, is as difficult to account for as is his total silence
with regard to a most important revision of the New Testament made in
the reign of Edward VI., called by the Company of Stationers "the most
vendible volume in English," and which was introduced into Parker's, or
the Bishop's Bible, in 1568. A good historical work on this subject is
greatly needed, showing not only the editions and gradual improvement,
but also the sources whence our translation was derived, and its
faithfulness and imperishable renown.</p>

<h3>
<span>"AS STARS WITH TRAINS OF FIRE," ETC.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 75.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Your correspondent A. E. B. has shown on more than one occasion so high
an appreciation of the wonderful powers of Shakspeare, and his
speculations in connexion therewith are so ingenious, that I feel
considerable regret when I am compelled to dissent from his conclusions.
I believe with him, that Shakspeare's learning has been very much
underrated; but at the same time it must be confessed, that so soon as
we abandon the intuition, which some would substitute for learning, by
which his knowledge was acquired, the latter ceases to be "mysterious."
I regret, however, to say that, if it could be shown that he wrote
"asters," and with the intention which A. E. B. claims for him, my
conclusion would be against that misuse of learning which left the
meaning of a passage dependent on the antithesis between two words used
each in a sense different from the usual one, and not understood by the
audience to whom they were addressed.</p>

<p>Let us now take another view of the question. The purpose of the passage
is to record the occurrence of a series of omens, the harbingers of
"fierce events." "The graves <i>stood tenantless</i>;" "the sheeted dead <i>did
squeak and gibber</i>;" "the moist star <i>was sick almost to doomsday with
eclipse</i>:" each circumstance is distinct. But what did "asters with
trains of fire," and "disasters in the sun" do? Mr. Knight says that
Malone's proposal to substitute "astres" for "as stars," appears to get
rid of the difficulty; but not until the English language admits of the
formation of a perfect sentence without a verb will it do so. In short,
there is nothing gained by the substitution, as Malone<a id="Page_155"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[155]</span> saw when
he proposed to turn "disasters" into "<i>disasterous</i>," and to supply the
verb.</p>

<p>I have no alteration of my own to propose; but I think possibly a
suggestion as to the directions to be taken in search of the right text
may be of service. In the case of a line or lines being lost, nothing
can be done; but I discern a gleam of hope in two other directions. In
the first place it is to be observed, that the thoughts of the speaker
would in all probability be turned to <i>night</i>-portents. There is a
reference to the same circumstances in <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, Act II. Sc. 2.,
as having occurred in the night, and been seen by the watch. Now, though
there is certainly no reason why Horatio might not have enumerated spots
in the sun as one of the omens preceding terrible events, it seems
scarcely probable that it was in the order of his allusions to the
events of the "fearful night" preceding the death of Cæsar. Let the
corruption then be sought for here. Or look for a verb in the place of
"disasters" that shall intelligibly connect "the sun" with what
precedes. "As stars" must not be changed into "asters" until it can be
shown that such change is necessary to a better constructed sentence
than any which has yet been suggested.</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Our life's a flying shadow, God's the pole,</p>
      <p>The index pointing at Him is our soul;</p>
  <p>    Death the horizon, when our sun is set,</p>
     <p> Which will through Christ a resurrection get."</p>

</div>

<p>That the above cannot now be classed among <i>living</i> inscriptions is
entirely to be ascribed to the zeal for clean walls exhibited by Her
Majesty's Commissioners of Woods and Forests, under whose auspices the
renovation of our cathedral has been accomplished. I regret to mention
some other memorials have also disappeared, long familiar to the eye of
the antiquary&mdash;not granting but that these gentlemen have a power to do
what they please; however, <i>en passant</i>, we would entreat, if they can,
to lay on their hands as charily as possible when such innocent matters
come in their way. Though the following well-known lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear,</p>
      <p>To dig the dust inclosed here;</p>
     <p> Blest be the man that spares these stones,</p>
     <p> And curst be he that moves my bones"&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">be not literally applicable in the present case, they breathe such a
spirit as would almost make any one "nervous" in tampering with revered
and time-honoured relics nearly become sacred.</p>

<p>Glasgow does not appear at all rich in dial erections; the only one I
know of is in our old street the Gallowgate (or <i>Gallow's Gate</i>; as you
would say, <i>the road to Tyburn</i>), on the south front of a tenement, with
no motto, but date 1708. Our long fame for numerous public clocks and
excellent bells, according to the ancient adage&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"<i>Glasgow for bells</i>,</p>
     <p> Linlithgow for wells,</p>
     <p> Falkirk for beans and pease,</p>
      <p>Edinburgh for wh&mdash;&mdash;s and thieves,"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">together with our frequent wet murky atmosphere, may all have
contributed to the unfavourableness of endeavouring to mark the flight
of Time through the medium of the solar rays.</p>

<p>The cities and villages under the sunny skies of southern climates, and
where also appears a better taste generally than with us for
inscriptions on public and private monuments, would, I think, be the
richest field for H<span class="smcap lowercase">ERMES</span> to explore. I speak from some little
observation in a tour of France and Italy, &amp;c., in the year 1846.
Sun-dials were to me objects of curiosity, but not of that importance as
to be engrossing. On a loose memorandum I have the two following mottoes
which particularly struck me, but have not preserved a note of the
places, that I think lay on the route from Florence to Bologna:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">(Latin Englished) "This dial indicates every hour to man but his
   last."</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Se il Sol benigno, mi concede il raggio,</p>
     <p> L'ora ti mostra, è il ciel ti dia buon viaggio."</p>

</div>

<p>On a building near the Cathedral of Geneva, there is rather a novel and
curious example of the sun-dial, in a perpendicular line bisected on
each side by two curves, the curve on the one side <i>black</i>, the other
<i>gilded</i>, with the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Fait en 1778&mdash;Restauré en 1824,</p>
      <p>La Courbe noire Indique le Midi du 21 Juin au 21 Décembre,</p>
                         <p class="i5"> et la</p>
     <p> Courbe dorée du 21 Décembre au 21 Juin."</p>

</div>

<p>Meridian lines, though not, properly speaking, coming under the order of
sun-dials, may be reckoned so far cognate; fine specimens of these may
be seen in the cathedrals of Milan, Bologna, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Public clocks occasionally become objects of considerable interest, as
at Berne, &amp;c., not to mention the <i>monster</i> of Strasbourg, which all the
world has heard of.</p>

<p>Quaint allegorising on such subjects as the foregoing, as presenting
different stages in the life of man and the fleeting nature of times and
things, were not unusual among our old Scotch divines, as in the
subsequent quotation from <i>The Last</i><a id="Page_156"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[156]</span> <i>Battell of the Soule in
Death</i>, by Mr. Zachary Boyd, Glasgow, 1629:&mdash;</p>

<h3>
<span>CAN BISHOPS VACATE THEIR SEES?<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 293.)</span>
</h3>

<p>In answer to your correspondent K. S.'s Query, "Can bishops vacate their
sees?" I have little hesitation in saying that they can; though I know
of no instance (in modern times) of such an occurrence (except colonial
bishops); nor have I ever heard of any one but Dr. Pearce who wished so
to do. Lord Dover is, however, mistaken in supposing that "his
resignation could not be received, on the ground that a bishopric, as
being a peerage, is inalienable." The bishop's own account of the matter
(see his Life, prefixed to his <i>Commentary on the Gospels and Acts</i>) is
as follows:&mdash;Feeling himself unable, from his age and other infirmities,
to perform any longer his duties as Bishop of Rochester, and wishing
like Charles V. to retire from the world, he requested his friend Lord
Bath to apply to the king for permission to resign. He was soon after
sent for by the king, who told him that he had consulted <i>Lord Mansfield
and Lord Northington, and that neither of them saw any objection</i>. In
the mean time, however, Lord Bath asked the king to appoint, as his
successor in the see of Rochester, Dr. Newton, then Bishop of Bristol.
On this the ministry, not wishing any ecclesiastical dignities to be
granted except through their hands, interfered so as to prevent the
resignation from being effected; Dr. Pearce being told by the king that
his resignation could not be accepted, but that he should have all the
credit of it.</p>

<p>Lord Dover's mistake is, I think, to be attributed to his assumption
that bishops are peers of the realm. This is, however, by no means the
case. A bishop is simply <i>a Lord of Parliament</i>, and possesses none of
the privileges of the peerage; not those, among others, of freedom from
arrest, and trial by their peers. A peer can only be deprived of his
peerage by a special act of parliament, and after a trial by the House
of Lords; while a bishop can be deprived of his see, and, of
consequence, of his seat in the House of Lords, by the sentence of the
archbishop of the province, assisted by such of his suffragans as he may
summon. The two last instances of deprivation were those of Bishop
Watson, of St. David's, by Archbishop Tenison, and of the Bishop of
Clogher, in 1822.</p>

<p>A bishop so deprived does not cease to be a bishop, but only ceases from
having jurisdiction over a diocese. Whether a bishop can be deposed from
his episcopal office altogether is a matter of doubt, though it is held
by most of those who are learned in the canon law, that there is not
sufficient authority in any ecclesiastical person, or body of persons,
to degrade from the office of bishop any one who has once received
episcopal consecration.</p>

<h3>
<span>CHARACTER OF A TRUE CHURCHMAN.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 105.)</span>
</h3>

<p>J. Y. makes an inquiry as to the author of the <i>Character of a True
Churchman</i>, printed 1711. Your correspondent will do me good service by
stating the size, and giving the first few words, of his tract. In 1702,
or perhaps in the preceding year, Richard West, D.D., Fellow of Magd.
Coll. Oxford, and prebendary of Winchester, published <i>The True
Character of a Churchman, showing the False Pretences to that Name</i>, one
sheet in quarto, no date, of which I have two editions; and it was
reprinted in the Somers' <i>Tracts</i>: "It is commonly observed," &amp;c. This
was answered by Sacheverell in <i>The Character of a Low Churchman</i>, 4to.
1702: "It cannot but be visible," &amp;c. And in the same year there was an
edition of both these characters printed, paragraph by paragraph, the
original character and the reply: London, for A. Baldwin.</p>

<p>I have also <i>The Character of a True Church of England Man</i>, a single
sheet in 4to.: London, by D. Edwards for N. C. 1702: "Next to the name
Christian." And <i>The True Churchman and Loyal Subject</i>: London, for J.
Morphew, 1710, 8vo. pp. 168.: "The name of the church in whose communion
I am," &amp;c. Is this the same with J. Y.'s book with another title?</p>

  <p class="right"> P. B.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> [We have submitted the above to J. Y., who states that "neither
   of the tracts mentioned by P. B. is the one noticed in his Query.
   It commences with the following words: 'He [<i>i.e.</i> the True
   Churchman] is one who is not only called a Christian, but is in
   truth and reality such.' Prefixed is a short letter from the
   author to his friend in the country; and the edition of 1711
   appears to have been the first. It makes sixteen pages of octavo,
   and consists of short sententious paragraphs, more practical and
   devotional than controversial. J. Y. discovered it in the British
   Museum bound up with Dr. Hickes' <i>Seasonable and Modest Apology</i>,
   and other tracts."]<a id="Page_157"></a>

<h3>
<span>WEARING GLOVES IN PRESENCE OF ROYALTY.<br />
(Vol. i., p. 366.; Vol. ii., pp. 165. 467.; Vol. v., p. 102.).</span>
</h3>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER'S</span> explanation (Vol. ii., p. 165.) is simple, and, <b>I</b> believe,
correct. The covered hands might be considered as discourteous as a
covered head: but why should uncovering either be a mark of respect? The
solution of this question seems to me of some curiosity, and may perhaps
be to many of your readers of some novelty. These and most other modern
forms of salutation and civility are derived from chivalry, or at least
from war, and they all betoken some deference, as from a conquered
person to the conqueror; just as in private life we still continue to
sign ourselves the "very humble servants" of our correspondent.</p>

<p>The <i>uncovered</i> head was simply the head <i>unarmed</i>; the helmet being
removed, the party was at mercy. So the hand <i>ungloved</i> was the hand
<i>ungauntleted</i>, and to this day it is an incivility to shake hands with
gloves on. Shaking hands itself was but a token of truce, in which the
parties took hold each of the other's <i>weapon-hand</i>, to make sure
against treachery. So also a gentleman's <i>bow</i> is but an offer of the
neck to the stroke of the adversary: so the lady's <i>curtsey</i> is but the
form of going <i>on her knees</i> for mercy. This general principle is
marked, as it ought naturally to be, still more strongly in the case of
military salutes. Why is a discharge of guns a <i>salute</i>? Because it
leaves the guns empty, and at the mercy of the opponent. And this is so
true, that the saluting with blank cartridge is a modern invention.
Formerly salutes were fired by discharging the cannonballs, and there
have been instances in which the compliment has been nearly fatal to the
visitor whom it meant to honour. When the <i>officer</i> salutes, he points
his drawn sword to the ground; and the salute of the troops is, even at
this day, called "<i>presenting arms</i>,"&mdash;that is, presenting them to be
taken.</p>

<p>There are several other details both of social and military salutation
of all countries which might be produced; but I have said enough to
indicate the principle.</p>

<h3>
<span>GOSPEL OAKS.<br />
(Vol. ii., p. 407.)</span>
</h3>

<p>The inquiry of S<span class="smcap lowercase">TEPHEN</span> into the origin of "this delightful name,"
applied to some fine old oak trees in different parts of the country,
has not elicited one answer, nor an additional note of other trees so
designated. Oaks are not the only trees so honoured; for I remember
reading of a "gospel <i>elm</i>," but where situated I do not recollect. Had
your valuable publication been then in existence, I should most probably
have made a note of it. It would be desirable to elucidate this
interesting subject; and if your correspondents would send you a note of
such as may be in their neighbourhoods, with the traditions attached to
them, much curious and interesting information would be accumulated; and
it is possible that some approximation to their date and origin might be
arrived at. The Rev. A. G. H. Hollingsworth, in his <i>History of
Stowmarket</i>, gives an account of a very fine one still remaining in the
park of Polstead Hall, Essex, the seat of Charles Tyrell, Esq.:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It stands (he writes) almost in front of the house, at a
   distance of about 150 yards, and close to the adjoining early
   Norman church. It rises like a small feudal tower out of the
   green field, to the height of twenty feet, and still possesses
   vigorous remains of the three enormous stems into which it was
   divided above. This earth-born giant is forty-three feet in
   circumference four feet from the ground, and the base slopes
   gradually outwards as the sides bury themselves in the earth,
   giving one the idea of a skilful architect's hand having
   systematically planted an enormous foundation for that stupendous
   mass of wood, with which 1000 or 1500 years must have loaded its
   shoulders. It is hollow within, and could seat eight or ten
   persons. The bark is generally gone, except in one or two places,
   where it winds like a stream of rough verdure to supply the
   branches, which still drop their acorns into your face as you
   gaze upwards, and are thus reminded of the passing seasons. Its
   wood is seared, knotted, and in some places looks like a piece of
   sculpture smoothed and wrought by hand into waving channels. By
   its side, and at a distance of some eight feet, is a tall oak of
   eighty years' growth,&mdash;a scion, no doubt, of such a mighty tree.
   But it looks puerile, and a child, when compared with its parent.
   And some idea may be formed of this, perhaps one of the last fast
   departing memorials of Roman and Saxon times, when on comparison
   it would take twenty or more such trunks of a hundred years'
   growth, to make up the bulk of the glorious size of this mighty
   pillar, thus erected by the hand of nature to the memory of past
   generations."</p>

<p>Mr. Hollingsworth appears to consider them relics of Druidism:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "When Christianity was first introduced into England, it was
   customary for the missionaries to select some one known gigantic
   tree as their place of assemblage. These leafy tabernacles were
   generally oaks of vast size and stature. Nor is it at all
   unlikely that some of them were thus chosen because from their
   gigantic bosoms the sacred mistletoe of the Druids had been cut,
   and they were consecrated by superstitious veneration in the
   minds of the people as sacred places. Nor were they inappropriate
   pulpits for the apostolic bishops and priests, who thus, in
   making their shades vocal with the gospel words, proclaimed by
   their voice and presence the victory of Christ over darkness and
   idolatry."&mdash;P. 18.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE PENDULUM DEMONSTRATION.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 84.)</span>
</h3>

<p>A few lines will suffice for my rejoinder to H. C. K.'s further
observations on this subject.</p>

<p>Since he and I are substantially of the same opinion as to the reality
of the phenomenon, it would be bootless to discuss the comparative
merits of the considerations that have led us to it. But inasmuch as I
am very careful in making assertions, so am I proportionately impatient
when their correctness is wrongfully impugned.</p>

<p>H. C. K., in remarking upon a statement of mine, enters into a
calculation to show that it is absurd. At least such I suppose to be the
meaning of the paragraph concluding with the words "which is absurd."</p>

<p>My assertion was, that the difference alluded to was "greatly in excess
of the alleged apparent motion."</p>

<p>Now "<i>the difference</i>" was fifty feet in twenty-four hours, or upwards
of two feet in the hour; and "<i>the alleged apparent motion</i>" had been
stated over and over again to be a complete revolution in about thirty
hours (for the latitude of London). Hence, the circumference of a
ten-feet circle being about thirty feet, it requires no great profundity
to discover that "the alleged apparent motion" is one foot in the hour;
but the "difference" in velocity is two feet in the hour, which surely
justifies the assertion that the latter is "greatly in excess" of the
former.</p>

<p>It would occupy too much space to show H. C. K. where it is that his
calculation has gone astray; but if he will reconsider it, he will
perceive, firstly, that he has no authority, except his own, for
assuming a revolution (of the line of oscillation) in <i>twenty-four</i>
hours; and secondly, that five feet <i>on either side</i> of the centre is
equal to ten feet altogether.</p>

<p>But, above all, he must recollect that his own original assertion (Vol.
iv., p. 236.), to which mine was but an answer, was, that "the
difference" would be "<i>practically nothing</i>:" of this even his own
calculation is a sufficient refutation.</p>

<h3>
<span>EXPURGATED QUAKER BIBLE.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 87. 412.; Vol. v., p. 44.)</span>
</h3>

<p>By favour of an intelligent and respected friend, I am enabled to send
some kind of answer to the inquiries made on this subject in your
Numbers.</p>

<p>The Society of Friends have never published nor authorised a mutilated
edition of the Holy Scriptures. The Bible in common use with them is the
authorised version of King James. The translation published in 1764, by
Antony Purver, a member of the Society, contains several alterations
from the received version, but it does not <i>omit</i> any part. Besides,
this edition never came into general use. It was too expensive, and too
bulky, being in two large folio volumes. It never was reprinted, and in
fact is seldom found except in public libraries. It is quite true, that
many of the Friends, as well as other Christians, have felt that there
are parts of the sacred volume, which at this time are ill suited for
being read aloud and discussed in a family circle: and some of them have
devised expedients for a ready selection of the most edifying portions
of Holy Writ for such occasions. One of their ministers, Mr. George
Withy, published a small tract in 1846, which he named <i>An Index to the
Holy Scriptures, intended to facilitate the Audible Reading thereof in
Families and in Schools</i>. His tract enumerates those chapters of the Old
and New Testaments, which he judged <i>most</i> suitable for that purpose.</p>

<p>In 1830, John Kendall (to whom one of your correspondents alludes)
published in 2 vols. 12mo. <i>The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament, by way of Abstract; containing what is more especially
Instructive in the Historical Parts, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i> He designed this for the
special use of young persons, and expressly states that "it was not
intended to supersede the reading of the Scriptures at large by those
who are come to an age of discernment." He adheres mostly, but not
entirely, to the words of the authorised version.</p>

<p>Twenty or thirty years later, the same feeling of the want of an edition
of the Bible <i>entirely</i> fit for audible reading in the presence of a
mixed family, induced Mr. William Alexander, a printer of York, to
endeavour to supply the deficiency: and after fourteen years of earnest
attention to the subject, he issued proposals for publishing a Bible so
arranged. It was designed to be in three (perhaps four) volumes,
imperial octavo size: but, for want of sufficient encouragement, only
the first volume appeared, containing the Pentateuch. This consists of
792 pages; has foot-notes, side-notes, and marginal references; together
with introductions to the several books, and dissertations upon sundry
interesting subjects. It is evident, that the whole work, if completed
in the same manner, would have been far too cumbrous for general use,
and could not have been sold for less than fifty shillings or three
pounds; so that we need not be surprised at its remaining unfinished, as
it would have been little likely to find its way into many of those
families for whose benefit it was kindly intended.</p>

<p>The author explains his views and manner of proceeding in his preface. I
cannot enter into them at length here. Where a single word or<a id="Page_159"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
expression in the authorised version appeared to him objectionable, he
has removed or changed it. Where entire verses, or a whole chapter,
seemed little fitted for family reading, he has placed such portions in
the lower part of the page, and has printed them in <i>Italics</i> by way of
distinction. He has also added a lineal arrangement of numerous passages
which seemed peculiarly fitted to exhibit the characteristic features of
Hebrew poetry.</p>

<p>Altogether, it appears that Mr. Alexander's object was most
praiseworthy, his learning considerable, and his diligence very great;
and it is to be hoped that the remaining portions of his work are not
lost, but that they may yet be made available in some manner for the
pious purpose which the author had in view.</p>

<h3>
<span>JUNIUS RUMOURS.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 125.)</span>
</h3>

<p>The experience of a pretty long life has taught me never to believe a
Junius "rumour"; never to believe in any story of a coming Junius, no
matter how confidently or circumstantially told, which is not <i>proved</i>;
and I think the short experience of the Editor of "N. &amp; Q." must have
convinced him that what is asserted on men's personal knowledge&mdash;the
evidence of their own eyes and ears (see case of Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span>, Vol. iii., p.
378.), may possibly be untrue, on the proof that it was impossible. Out
of respect, however, to "N. &amp; Q.," I will say a few words on the rumours
to which
J<span class="smcap lowercase">UNIUS</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIST</span> refers.</p>

<p>One of your correspondent's rumours is to this effect, that an eminent
bookseller was lately called in to value certain MSS., and thus
accidentally discovered who "Atticus <i>or</i> Brutus was, and <i>consequently</i>
who Junius himself was." This <i>consequently</i> is certainly a most
astounding <i>non-sequitur</i> to those who are reasonably well-informed as
to the present state of the Junius question. But let that pass. Still I
must observe that your correspondent is dealing with a rumour; that the
rumour does not tell us whether the discovery is inferential or
positive&mdash;relates to Atticus or Brutus: nothing can well be more vague.
Now my "rumour" said the discovery was of the writer of the letters of
Lucius. Under these circumstances it would be idle to waste another line
in speculation: enough for the information of your correspondent, if I
add, that in one case the discovery <i>might</i> help us to a <i>conjecture</i>
who Junius <i>was</i>; in another, might prove who he was <i>not</i>.</p>

<p>As to the "rumours" about the scents contained in the <i>Grenville
Papers</i>, they would fill a volume. They have been buzzing about for more
than a quarter of a century. The nonsense of one-half was demonstrable
by any intelligent person who would have taken the trouble to examine
and test them: but nobody did take such trouble. "N. &amp; Q." was not then
in existence. The most plausible, and seemingly, from its
circumstantiality, best authenticated version, was given by Mr. Barker,
in 1828, to the effect that three letters had been discovered, one of
which had a fictitious signature; another asked legal advice of Mr.
Grenville as to publishing the letter to the King; and the third
enclosed a copy of Junius's letter to Lord Mansfield, signed with the
author's initials, and with a reference therein to a letter received
from Mr. Grenville.</p>

<p>The publication of the letters will soon put an end to "rumour."
Meanwhile the few following facts will dispose of Mr. Barker's
circumstantial fictions, and perhaps satisfy your correspondent.</p>

<p>There are amongst the <i>Grenville Papers</i> three letters, dated Feb.,
Sept., and Nov., 1768; the <i>last</i> therefore before the <i>first</i> Junius
was published.</p>

<p><i>Two</i> of these letters are signed with the initial C.; and, on the
similarity of the handwriting, it is assumed that the <i>three</i> letters
came from the same person. The writer of the <i>unsigned</i> letter claims to
have written many of the letters which had latterly appeared in the
newspapers, and, amongst others, a letter signed Atticus, a copy of
which he encloses. This is according to my recollection; but I will not
say positively that he does not claim to be the writer of the <i>letters</i>
signed Atticus. The question, therefore, at present stands thus:&mdash;The
connexion of these letters with the writer of Junius's letters is an
inference or assumption, not a fact. It remains to be proved: and, for
anything I know to the contrary, it may hereafter be proved by the
editor of the <i>Grenville Papers</i>,&mdash;a diligent and careful man,&mdash;that the
unknown writer of the unsigned letter is worthy of belief; that he was
the same person who wrote the two letters signed C.; that Mr.
Grenville's correspondent C. in 1768, was Woodfall's correspondent C. in
1769; and then, whether Mr. Grenville's Atticus was the same Atticus
whose four letters were published as written by Junius, by Mr. <i>George</i>
Woodfall in the edition of 1812. Simple as this last question may
appear, and naturally as most persons would come to a conclusion on the
subject, I think it well to mention as a warning, that there were, as
admitted in the <i>Public Advertiser</i>, two persons who about the same time
wrote under that signature, and I think clear evidence of a third
writer.</p>

 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M. has to contend
with is evidently this: how came the eminent Hebrew scholars, who were
the authors of the ancient versions&mdash;how came the whole body of Jewish
Rabbis who have written upon the law, to be ignorant of what seems so
clear to
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M., that
<span title="[Hebrew: hkthvbym]">&#1492;&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, in the passage in question was in
fact a proper name, denoting <i>the place</i> in which Eldad and Medad were?
How came it that they all took it in the sense expressed in our English
version? [I do not admit the Chaldee paraphrase as an exception
(notwithstanding what
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M. remarks), because the words
<span title="[Hebrew: vnvn bkthyby]">&#1489;&#1499;&#1514;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;
  &#8206;&#1493;&#1488;&#1504;&#1493;&#1503;</span>
are an exact rendering of the Hebrew text, and partake of the same
ambiguity, if there be any ambiguity.] The legend which I quoted from
Rashi clearly proves that the Jews of his time understood the passage as
our English translators have done. This is
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M.'<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> difficulty: and how
does he meet it? He says, "What of that, if they happen to be wrong?
Such a consideration will never interfere with my own judgment, founded
on a thorough knowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word."</p>

<p>What is this but to say that the Septuagint translators, the authors of
the other ancient versions, the Jewish Rabbis, had not the same
"thorough knowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word" which
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M. "in
his own judgment" believes himself to possess? I do not, however,
suppose that
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M. really intends to set up his own judgment against
these authorities, as if he was better acquainted with Hebrew than those
who lived when the language was vernacular; but when he tells us "that
he has long since learned that opinions are not necessarily true because
they are old, nor doctrines undeniably infallible because we have
believed them from our cradles," it becomes necessary to remind him that
I never asserted any such thing, and that my argument, from authority,
amounted simply to this,&mdash;that the judgment of the LXX, and other
ancient translators, with that of all the Jewish Rabbis of later date,
was a better authority, in my judgment, as to the meaning of a Hebrew
word, than the unsupported opinion of
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARGOLIOUTH</span>, which (as it
seems to me) is also inconsistent with the context of the passage. If
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M. will produce the judgment of any other authority, especially of
those who lived near the time when Hebrew was a vernacular language (for
this is what makes the age of the authority valuable), his opinion will
be more worthy of attention.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M. says, as one of his arguments, "It would appear that
 D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. T<span class="smcap lowercase">ODD</span>
himself found the
<span title="[Hebrew: b]">&#1489;</span> insurmountable, and therefore omitted it
in his last Hebrew quotation."</p>

<p>This omission was the error of your printer, not mine; and I think any
one who did not greatly need such an argument, must have seen that it
was a mistake of the press. In my own defence I must say that I had not
the advantage of being allowed to correct the press.</p>

<p>I do not deny that
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M.'<span class="smcap lowercase">S</span> interpretation is ingenious and clever, but
it is for this reason especially that I object to it; Holy Scripture is
too sacred a thing to be trifled with by ingenious conjectures: it is
easy for a man of talent like
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M. to gain a reputation with the
unlearned by affecting to correct our English version on a "thorough
knowledge of Hebrew words." This is a rock upon which many have
foundered; the temptation is very great to a man like
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M., who has
been brought up with a verbal knowledge of the Hebrew Scriptures: and it
is in no unkindly spirit towards him, but very much the reverse, that I
venture to give him this warning.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Rotten Row.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I cannot agree with any of the etymologies of this
phrase, as given at p. 441. of Vol. i., p. 235. of Vol. ii., or at p.
40. of Vol. v. of "N. &amp; Q.," because I have found the same applied to
many places with which such etymologies could not, by any possibility,
have the remotest connexion. In my examination of the <i>Hundred Rolls</i> or
<i>Acre Books</i> of the various parishes in the hundred of Skirbeck in
Lincolnshire, I found that a portion of several of those parishes was
named <i>Rotten Row</i>: I will instance two, Freiston and Bennington. Upon
consulting the best authorities I could meet with, I found that Camden
derives the name from <i>Rotteran</i>, to muster; and we know that the Barons
de Croun and their descendants, the Lords Rous, who formerly held the
manor of Freiston, were in the habit of mustering their vassals under
arms. "William Lord Ros, then residing at Ros Hall, Freiston, received a
command to attend Edward II. at Coventry; and hastened to him with all
his men at arms, divers <i>Hoblers</i>, and some foot soldiers accordingly."
(See Dugdale's <i>Baronage</i>.) That the term <i>Rotten Row</i> has this military
origin receives additional corroboration from the fact, that in Blount's
<i>Glossographia</i>, 1670, the word
 R<span class="smcap lowercase">OT</span> is defined to be "a term of war; six
men (be they pikes or musketeers) make a <i>Rot</i> or file." Under the word
B<span class="smcap lowercase">RIGADE</span> in the same dictionary, I find it stated that "six men make a
<i>Rot</i>, and three <i>Rots</i> of Pikes make a corporalship, but the
musqueteers have four <i>Rots</i> to a corporalship. Nine <i>Rots</i> of pikes and
twelve <i>Rots</i> of musqueteers, or 126 men, make a complete company." In
Cole's <i>Dictionary</i>, 1685, I find
 "R<span class="smcap lowercase">OT</span>, a file of six soldiers."</p>

<p>From these authorities I am led to infer that<a id="Page_161"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[161]</span> the term <i>Rotten
Row</i> is a corruption of the name originally applied to the place where
the feudal lord of a town or village held his <i>Rother</i> or muster, and
where the <i>Rots</i>, into which his vassals were divided, assembled for the
purpose of military exercise.</p>

<p>&mdash;To the question of E. F. L.,
as to what time the custom of mitigating the punishment of condemned
Scottish criminals to perpetual servitude was done away with, I cannot
at present give a definite answer; but perhaps the following curious
extract from the <i>Decisions</i> of Fountainhall may be interesting to
enquirers on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Reid, the <i>Mountebank</i>, pursues Scot of Harden and his Lady, for
   stealing away from him a little Girl, called the <i>Tumbling
   Lassie</i>, that danced upon his stage; and he claimed damages, and
   produced a contract, whereby he <i>bought her from her mother</i>, for
   £30 Scots. But <i>we have no Slaves in Scotland</i>, and mothers
   cannot sell their bairns; and physicians attested the employment
   of tumbling would kill her; and her joints were now grown stiff,
   and she declined to return; though she was at least a 'prentice,
   and so could not run away from her master; yet some cited Moses's
   Law, that if a servant shelter himself with thee, against his
   master's cruelty, thou shalt surely not deliver him up. The
   lords, <i>renitente cancellario</i>, assoilzied Harden, on the 27th
   January (1687)."&mdash;Vol. i. p. 439.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Cibber's Lives of the Poets</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., pp. 25., 116.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;P. T. says that
"he has not Croker's <i>last</i> edition of Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>," to
which
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROSSLEY</span> had referred him as to Shiells' share in Cibber's
<i>Lives</i>. He has printed "last" in Italics; but I see reason to suspect
that he has not seen <i>any</i> of Mr. Croker's editions, nor even Boswell's
own; for the MS. note which he quotes from a fly-leaf of his (P. T.'s)
copy of the <i>Lives of the Poets</i>, is nothing but a verbal repetition of
what Boswell had stated on Dr. Johnson's authority in his text, but of
which he had added a refutation in a note; which note, with some
corroborative circumstances, was repeated in <i>both</i> Mr. Croker's
editions.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that Shiells misled Johnson, and that Johnson
misled Stevens, into the statement which P. T. has copied at some <i>third
or fourth hand</i>, after it had been twice or thrice refuted.</p>

<p>It is a little hard that your valuable space should be taken up by
gentlemen who will not even take the trouble of referring to the
authorities where you tell them that they will find an answer, and then
begin questioning again, as if you had not already settled the matter.</p>

<p>&mdash;W. B. asks the meaning of the word <i>stoke</i>
in the names of places; as Bishopstoke, Ulverstoke, &amp;c. (Ulverstoke
being, I presume, a miscopying or misprint of Alverstoke). I cannot at
all concur in the derivation you quote from Bosworth, from <i>stoc</i>, "a
place;" for then every place might be called <i>stoke</i> without
distinction. But in all the <i>stokes</i> that I remember in England there is
always and actually a kind of <i>stockade</i> or sluice, which dams up some
watercourse to a certain level. Whether this explanation will apply to
the local circumstances of all the <i>stokes</i>, I know not; but it
certainly does to the cases of Bishopstoke and Alverstoke, and of at
least half a dozen other <i>stokes</i> within my own observation.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Eliza Fenning</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 105.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Eliza Fenning was a maid servant
convicted and executed for poisoning her master's family. I happened to
be very intimate with some charitable and distinguished persons who had
doubts of her guilt. I myself did not partake those doubts, but I
assisted my friends in their benevolent inquiries, and was so frequently
in communication with them both at the time, and long after, that I
think I may venture to say that there can be no foundation for the
statement that another person had confessed to the crime for which she
suffered.</p>

<p class="right">  C.</p>




<p>On or about Christmas Day, 1833, there may be found in <i>The Times</i>
newspaper a notice of the<a id="Page_162"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[162]</span> death of a man, who, after leading a
dissolute life, ended his days in the workhouse of some town either in
Suffolk or Essex. On his death-bed he confessed that he was the brother
of the law-stationer, and that he had put the poison into the pudding,
by the eating of which his brother and family died, and for which crime
Eliza Fenning had suffered innocently.</p>

<p class="right">  F. HH.</p>


<p>With reference to the inquirer respecting Elizabeth Fenning, I would
remark, that I well remember that it was inserted in a provincial paper,
many years ago, that Turner, in whose family the poisoning took place,
had confessed before his death that he himself was the guilty person. My
impression is, that it was inserted in an Ipswich newspaper. There was
great excitement in London at the time of Eliza Fenning's execution, and
the house of Turner had to be protected from the fury of the populace.
Mr. Hone had several pamphlets at his shop window on the circumstance. I
have heard Mr. Richard Taylor say she was the last person condemned by
Sir John Sylvester.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Ghost Stories</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 5.; Vol. v., pp. 89. 136.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I hope it
will not be thought that I mean to vouch for the truth of the stories
after which I am inquiring, if it should turn out that there really are
any; and also that I shall not be thought captious if I am not satisfied
with the substitutes which are proposed. When your correspondent says
that Reichenbach's "system may be advantageously applied to the
explanation of corpse-candles, illuminated churchyards, and other
articles of Welsh and English superstition," I can only say that, as far
as I understand the superstitions referred to, nobody ever thought of
connecting <i>them</i> with <i>ghosts</i>. There may be stories of "illuminated
churchyards," with ghosts in them, of which I have not heard but no
ghosts are mentioned by your correspondent. I am not laying undue stress
on a word. If the word <i>ghost</i> means anything, it means a <i>spirit</i>; and
I apprehend that the enlightened Baron will not thank any friend who
would sink, or explain away, that meaning. So, I presume, his translator
Dr. Ashburner understood him, when he triumphantly exclaimed, "The
<i>glorious</i> Reichenbach has, in this treatise, done good service against
the <i>vile demon of superstition</i>," p. 180. These words would have been
too grand for the celebration of such a petty triumph as snuffing out
Welsh candles, and explaining one or two small superstitions of the
vulgar. I must therefore again, if you will allow me, ask whether
anybody knows of such stories as would really meet what appears to be
the meaning of the author and translator.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Autographs of Weever and Fuller</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 474. 507.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Upon
reading the Query of A. E. C., I remembered to have seen some of
Weever's handwriting a year or two since, in the copy of his <i>Funerall
Monuments</i> in the library of Queen's College, Cambridge, of which I was
then librarian. I have since written to a resident member of the
college, who has kindly sent me a careful tracing of the MS. note; it is
as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>The tracing, the accuracy of which may be relied upon, I shall be very
happy to lend to A. E. C., if it will be of any service to him. Fuller's
autograph has not yet been discovered in the library, but, I have reason
to believe, will be found in the President's lodge.</p>

<p>&mdash;It has been
already shown that these lines are <i>not</i> Byron's, but are to be found in
the 12th chapter of Sir W. Scott's <i>Monastery</i>. I write now for the
purpose of noting, that in a similar collection, almost exclusively of
the Evangelical school, called <i>Sacred Poetry</i>, and published by
Oliphant of (I think) Edinburgh, Byron's lines from <i>The Giaour</i>,
beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p class="noindent">"Yes! Love indeed is light from heaven;</p>
        <p>A spark of that immortal fire,</p>

        <p>To lift from Earth each low desire," &amp;c.&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">are printed with the "Allah" of the third line simply changed into
"Jesus!" And so a passage, applicable solely to the earthly Eros, is
made to do duty as descriptive of another love of which the noble poet
had, I fear, remarkably little notion. The editors have had the grace
not to append Byron's name as the author. How far is this mode of
"improving" a passage honest?</p>

<p>&mdash;I cannot dispossess my mind of
the impression that, like the theological word <i>hell</i>, so the
agricultural term <i>hell-rake</i> is derived front the well-known Saxon word
signifying to <i>cover</i>.</p>

<p>Every Devonshire vestryman or mason well enough knows what is meant by
the "helling," or "heleing," or "heeling," of a church, viz. the
covering of the roof; and every farmer or labourer in the west will tell
you, that the <i>second-helling</i> of potatoes is the covering them with
earth a second time. Query: Was not the <i>hell-rake</i> originally an
implement used in husbandry for the purposes of <i>covering</i> the
broad-cast seed, and for other kindred purposes?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Family Likenesses</i> </span>

<p>&mdash;The remarkable preservation of a
family likeness is the subject<a id="Page_163"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[163]</span> of one of your "Minor Notes." It
has been often observed, I believe, that in the continuation of such
resemblance, a generation is not unfrequently passed over, and the son
is not like the father, but the grandfather. The Note recalled to my
mind some powerful lines in a poem, printed more than forty years ago,
for private circulation only, which I transcribe, thinking that perhaps
you may consider them not unsuited to your pages. To establish the
relationship of one who claims kindred with another, several proofs are
offered, viz. a bracelet, a ring, a letter: but the satisfactory
evidence is afforded by the family resemblance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "That bracelet with Elmina's hair,</p>
     <p> That bridal ring which join'd the pair,</p>
     <p> From Geoffrey, or from Geoffrey's son,</p>
      <p>By craft or outrage might be won.</p>
      <p>That letter, where I seem to view</p>

    <p>  Or penn'd for others, not for thee.</p>
     <p> But the mild lustre of her eye,</p>
      <p>Soft as the tint of noontide sky,</p>
  <p>  The grace that once her lips array'd,</p>
     <p> Nor force nor fraud could thine have made.</p>
      <p>The semblance of Elmina dead</p>
     <p> Thus o'er thy every feature spread,</p>

<span><i>Grimsdyke</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv. <i>passim</i>).</span>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent N<span class="smcap lowercase">AUTILUS</span> asks it
there are any ancient entrenchments in England known by the name of
<i>Grimsdyke</i>, besides the one he mentions in Hants. I have to inform him
that one of the most remarkable of the <i>many Celtic and Druidical
remains</i> on Dartmoor, in the county of Devon, is <i>Grimspound</i>, with its
dyke or ditch, a small stream running through, or just outside, its
circumvallation. He will find two very good accounts of it lately
published, one in <i>A Perambulation of the Ancient and Royal Forest of
Dartmoor</i>: by Samuel Rowe, M.A., Vicar of Crediton (published by
Hamilton, Adams &amp; Co.); and another, in a <i>Guide to the Eastern
Encampment of Dartmoor</i>, <i>with a Descriptive Map</i> (published by Dr.
Croker, of South Bovey).<a id="ovey2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#ovey2" class="label">[2]</a> The
 <i>Guide</i> is published by Holden, Exeter; and Kirkman and
Thackray, London.]</p>

<p>There is a good print of Grimspound in Mr. Rowe's book, who describes it
as by far the finest and most extraordinary of all the relics of this
class. Its situation is on the N.W. slope of Hamel Down, on the borders
of the parishes of Manaton (Colonel Hamilton says, <i>Maen-y-dun</i>, the
fort or inclosure of erect stones), North Bovey, and Widdecombe. Dr.
Croker says Grimspound is about 400 feet diameter; the wall inclosing
the area is formed of loose stones (granite), several of which are of
immense size: when first erected it appears to have been about twelve
feet in height. There are two entrances, N. and S., with evident marks
of a pavement. Within are many smaller circles formed by erect stones
three feet high, and in general twelve feet in diameter.</p>

<span><i>Portraits of Wolfe.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;I have by me a print well known by "hearsay" to
all the admirers of Hogarth (though evidently none of <i>his</i>
performance), the print of "A living dog is better than a dead lion." It
shows a profile likeness of Wolfe, which certainly corresponds with
every other likeness I have seen of him. I never saw any other print of
it but that in my possession.</p>

<p>Now we are upon the subject of Wolfe's portraits, it may not be amiss to
state that in the celebrated print by Woollett, every face there was
engraved by the celebrated Ryland; for this I had the authority of my
father, who was acquainted with him.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Jenings or Jennings Family</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 424.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Mr. Jennings or
Jennens (William), of Acton Place, Suffolk, who died at the close of the
last century, was a son of Robert Jennens, who served as aide-de-camp to
the great Duke of Marlborough. <i>His</i> grandfather Humphrey was settled in
Warwickshire, became an eminent iron manufacturer in Birmingham, and
afterwards purchased extensively in Leicestershire. The father of
Humphrey was settled for some time at Hales Owen in Shropshire; but I
have reason to believe his family came from Yorkshire, as suggested by
A. B. C. of Brighton. The will of Humphrey was dated Feb. 25th, 1651;
and, as it was proved, may throw some light on his kindred. Various
works touching on the pedigrees of Yorkshire may also give the querist
information, especially Whitaker's <i>Ducatus Leodiensis</i> and his <i>Leodis
and Elmete</i>, Surtees' publications, Part I. for 1836; Cleveland's
<i>Cleveland</i>; Davis's <i>York Records</i>; Hunter's <i>South Yorkshire</i>;
Nichols's <i>Collectanea Topographica et Geneologica</i>, vols. iv. and viii.
&amp;c. &amp;c. Doubtless, too, there are local histories of Craven and Ripon
which might aid his object; but if it would justify expense, he should
examine the diocesan and parochial registries of York in regard to those
localities. Mr. Jennens died at a very advanced age, having been the
godson of William III., and afterwards page of George I. He amassed an
immense property in lands and stock, much of which is, I believe,
unappropriated and yet unclaimed.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The Father of Cardinal Pole</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 105.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I. J. H. H. does not
state by what authority Sir Richard Pole is styled "a Welsh knight:" and
the surmise that this name was a corruption of Powell<a id="Page_164"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[164]</span> is clearly
unfounded. The not uncommon names of De la Pole, Atte Pole, and Poole,
are of English origin; belonging to the <i>minor</i> class of local
cognomina, like Brook, Gate, Wood, &amp;c. The family from which the
cardinal sprang was wholly distinct from the De la Poles, earls and
dukes of Suffolk, and can only be traced for three generations: but the
series of "Pedigrees of Noble Families related to the Blood Royal,"
made, it is believed, by Wriothesley Garter, and printed in the first
volume of the <i>Collectanea Topogr. et Genealogica</i>, throws some light
upon it. It appears that Sir Richard Pole and Alianor, who was married
to Ralph Verney, Esq., and had issue, were the children of <i>Geoffrey
Pole of Buckinghamshire</i> by Edith, daughter of Sir Oliver St. John, and
half-sister to Margaret, Countess of Richmond, the mother of King Henry
VII. Sir Harris Nicolas, who edited the pedigrees in question, remarks
upon this alliance:</p>

<p class="blockquot">      "It has been a subject of surprise that Sir Richard
      Pole, of whom, or of whose family, little was known,
      should have married Margaret Countess of Salisbury,
      the last descendant of the Plantagenets. One of these
      pedigrees proves that Sir Richard Pole was nearly
      related to the king, which accounts for the fact."</p>

<p>Sir Harris Nicolas further remarks, that where, in another page of the
same manuscript, the arms of Sir Geoffrey Pole (for he was, it seems, a
knight) ought to have been inserted, the shield is <i>left blank</i>; and
that the coat which is engraved on the garter-plate of Sir Richard Pole
at Windsor, being Party per pale argent and sable, a saltire engrailed
counterchanged, appears as if it may have been formed upon the saltire
of the Nevilles, in allusion to the great inheritance of his wife, the
Lady Margaret of Clarence.</p>

<span><i>Sir Gammer Vangs</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. ii., pp. 89. 280. 396.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have just found
some account of this absurd story in Swift's <i>Correspondence</i>, Scott's
edition, vol. xvi. p. 306. It seems to have been printed in a pamphlet,
a copy of which was sent to the Dean by his friend Mr. Ludlow (Sept. 10,
1718), under the name of <i>Sir Politic Would-be</i>, who gives it sportively
(as I always thought it <i>really</i> had) a political meaning, and there
seems to have been some allusion in it to the Dean himself. The pamphlet
may, perhaps, be found in some of the Irish libraries.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Delighted, Meaning of</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. ii., pp. 113. 329.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A discussion was,
some time ago, carried on in the pages of "N. &amp; Q." relative to the
signification of the word <i>delighted</i> as used by Shakspeare. The same
word occurs in a sense very different from that which it now bears in
the "Epistle Dedicatory" (dated 1667) to <i>The City and Country Purchaser
and Builder</i>, by Stephen Primatt. The book is dedicated to Sir Orlando
Bridgman and "the rest of the Justices and Barons appointed&mdash;&mdash;for
Determination of Differences touching Houses burnt down or demolished by
reason of the late Fire in London," and the following is the passage
alluded to:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The truely merited reputation by your Honours equal ballancing
   the Scales of Justice, hath, and is the daily cause of so many
   Petitioners to you for the same, especially in the late
   wisely-erected Court of Judicature; wherein your Honours, by your
   quick and <i>delighted</i> equitable dispatch of such differences as
   have come before you, hath sufficiently testified your undoubted
   loyalty to our Sovereign Lord the King, and amity to his people,"
   &amp;c.</p>

<span><i>Stops, when first introduced</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 1.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The semicolon had been
freely used in England some years before the date (1589) of Puttenham's
<i>Arte of English Poesie</i>. If Sir Henry Ellis will turn to the first
edition of Archbishop Sandys' Sermons, <i>Sermons made by the most
reuerende Father in God, Edwin, Archbishop of Yorke</i>: At London, printed
by Henrie Midleton, for Thomas Charde, 1585, he will find semicolons in
abundance. I see that the note of interrogation occurs in <i>A Compendiovs
and very frvtefvl treatyse teachynge the waye of Dyenge well</i>, <i>by
Thomas Lupsete;</i> London, 1541. It is no doubt to be found at an earlier
date, but my poor library does not afford an older English book. The
same mark, I may add, was used as a note both of interrogation and of
exclamation.</p>

<span><i>Monton in Pembroke</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 371.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have to remark that this
mountain, or monton (the meaning of which B. B. finds it difficult to
explain), is situated outside the walls of Pembroke on the adjoining
hill; and there is now the remains of a priory in or about the midst to
which this village belonged, and that in old deeds it is written
Monkton, or Moncton. Perhaps this may solve his difficulty.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Catterick for Cattraeth</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 453.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I understand
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">TEPHENS</span> to insinuate that Cattraeth means Catterick or <i>vice versâ</i>.
That both names begin with <i>cat</i>, and so much only, I am able to
concede.</p>

<p>Catterick was Cataractonium, or Cataracta, a Latin word of Greek
derivation, alluding to the rapids of the Swale. No man can dispute that
Cat-traeth is a compound of regular and truly idiomatic formation.
Therefore the best meaning<a id="Page_165"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[165]</span> I can surmise is this: that Aneurin,
wishing to play upon the syllable <i>cat</i>, the battle, and disregarding
the falsehood and inapplicability of <i>traeth</i>, therefore travestied
Cataracta into Cattraeth. For the meaning of <i>traeth</i>, in topography,
see Giraldus, <i>Itin. Cambr.</i> lib. ii. cap. 6., and the common sources of
information.</p>

<p>But that meaning was not one tolerated by Aneurin, maugre its untruth,
in order to avail himself of the other and appropriate word. It was one
on which he leant heavily and with emphasis, reproducing, and
multiplying it in several forms. For he calls the scene of contest not
only Cat-traeth, seabeach of battle, but also Gall-traeth, sea-beach of
prowess; and Mordai, the sea-shore: "Gododin ar llawr mordai: Gododin
whose ground-plot is on the sea-shore." Again, the scene of "outcry and
slaughter" is called Uffin; but Uffin was situate on "y mordai ymmoroedd
Gododin," on the sea-shore of the sea of Gododin.</p>

<p>Catterick is remote from the sea, and inconsistent with all that Aneurin
says. And though Sigston should mean in Anglo-Saxon <i>town of victory</i>,
from some ancient occurrence, Catterick is assuredly not derived from
<i>cat</i>, a battle, in British. Bilinguar etymology, of the same date, and
from the same event, would be suspicious, even if facts did not confute
it.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Biographical Dictionary</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 483.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It is almost unnecessary
to direct Z. Z. Z. to the <i>Biographical Dictionary</i> of the Society for
the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, inasmuch as it is but a splendid
fragment, comprising only the letter A, in seven half-volumes. But it
may be of use to call attention to this work; and as, from an
examination of the plan, the names of the contributors, and that of the
editor, no one can have any doubt of its worth and superiority, so one
would imagine that an enterprising publisher might take up the
continuation of it without risk.</p>

<span><i>A Regular Mull</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iii., pp. 449. 508.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The suggestions of W. E.
W. and M. as to the origin of this expression are amusing, and show,
however farfetched the derivations, their authors have not gone so far
as "Malabar or Deccan." Had either of these gentlemen been from the land
of the wise, they would have known that the residents of Bengal, Bombay,
and Madras are, in Eastern parlance, designated "Qui Hies," "Ducks," and
"Mulls." Madras not hitherto having been so highly favoured by "Kumpanie
Jehân," is in a comparatively less advanced stage of civilisation than
its sister presidencies. The Qui Hies and Ducks, attributing this to the
inertness and want of go-a-headness of the Mulls, hold them (though most
unjustly) in cheap estimation; hence they say of a person deficient in
skill and cleverness that he is "a regular Mull."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The Pelican as a Symbol of the Saviour</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 59.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Lord
Lindsay's <i>Christian Art</i>, vol. i. xx. xxi., we find, in the text: "God
the Son (is symbolised) by a Pelican" (Psalm cii. 6.), to which is added
the following note:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The mediæval interpretation of this symbol is given as follows
   by Sir David Lindsay of the Mount, Lion King (nephew of the
   poet), in his MS. Collectanea, preserved in the Advocates'
   Library, Edinburgh:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "'The Pellican is ane foule in Egipt, of the quhilkis auld men
   sayis that the litill birdis straikis thair fader in the face
   with thair wingis, and crabis him quhill (till) he slayis thame.
   And quhen the moder seis thame slane, scho greitis (weeps) and

<h4>
<span><i>Donkey</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 78.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;C. W. G. asks, "What is the origin of
<i>donkey</i>?" Perhaps he may consider the following (from the great
authority) as satisfactory. Porson was introduced to a <i>Danish</i>
archæologist of celebrity, who, thinking it necessary to say something
to Porson, rather abruptly addressed him thus: "I dink, Mr. Porson, that
you vil agree wid me, that asses is derived from Asia." Porson eyed the
learned Dane, and observed: "Yes, Sir, about as much as that <i>donkey</i> is
derived from Denmark: and that is a thought that never struck me till
now."</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p>A Note on the coins of Edward III. by
P<span class="smcap lowercase">ROFESSOR</span> <span class="smcap lowercase"> VAN DER</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">H&#376;S</span>, director
of the cabinet of coins and medals in the University of Leyden, in a
former part of this Number, reminds us to inform our readers that the
Teyler's Society in Haarlem have just published the treatise on the
coins of the ancient duchies of Brabant and Limberg from the earliest
times to the pacification of Ghent, referred to by the professor, who,
has been several years occupied in making drawings and descriptions of
coins in his own collection, in the cabinet under his care, and in other
public and private collections in the Netherlands and neighbouring
countries. His work, comprising more than 400 quarto pages of
description and historical research, with 36 well-executed plates
containing 470 specimens of coins from original drawings, supplies a
want long felt, and will be equally welcomed by the lover of coins and
the student of history. It is not less remarkable for its cheapness than
for its beauty.</p>

<p>Since the days when Teofilo Folengo, who has with some propriety been
regarded as the forerunner of Rabelais, gave to the world, under the
name of Merlinus Cocaius, the "Libriculum ludicrum et curiosum, partim
latino, partim italiano sermone compositum," which may be said to have
called into existence that burlesque style of composition which is now
understood by the term Macaronic, not only has he found many imitators,
but his and their works have always found a numerous class of purchasers
at least, if not of readers. In 1829, Genthe gave to the literary world
of Germany an excellent history of the works of this peculiar class. He
was followed in this country in 1831 by Mr. Sandys, who then gave us his
interesting <i>Specimens of Macaronic Poetry;</i> and we have now to thank M.
Octave Delepierre for his <i>Macaronéana, ou Mélanges de Littérature
Macaronique des différents Peuples de l'Europe</i>&mdash;an agreeable and
amusing work upon the same subject. M. Delepierre, while busied in its
preparations, has had the advantage of consulting the library of M. Van
de Weyer, which appears to be as rich in this peculiar branch of
bibliography, as it is known to be not only in every department of the
literature of the Low Countries, but in everything that relates to the
general history of literature.</p>

<p>When we consider the unwearied zeal and well-directed perseverance
manifested by Mrs. Cowden Clarke in her admirable <i>Concordance to
Shakspeare</i>, and the unvarying good taste and great ability with which
she has shadowed forth the infant life of those female characters which
Shakspeare has drawn with such mastery,&mdash;we feel that we have scarcely
done justice to <i>The Girlhood of Shakspeare's Heroines</i> in allowing this
graceful and interesting series of Tales to draw to the close, to which
it has now been brought by the publication of <i>Viola the Twin</i> and
<i>Imogen the Peerless</i>, without having directed the attention of our
readers to the various tales, as they were from time to time presented
to the world. The press has been unanimous in commending the plan
proposed to herself by Mrs. Clarke, as well as her execution of it; and
although at the eleventh hour, we join most heartily in a commendation
as well deserved as it has been universally bestowed.</p>

<p>If Authors have their peculiar calamities, they may console themselves
by the reflection that Editors have also some which are peculiarly their
own. Is it a small matter to receive a book (with a title which alone
would occupy nearly a column) containing upwards of a thousand
closely-printed pages, and be expected to give, in the short space which
we can allot to such notes, an account of its objects, merits, &amp;c.? And
yet, when one reads in the opening of <i>The Grammar of English Grammars,
with an Introduction, Historical and Critical; the whole methodically
arranged and amply illustrated</i>, &amp;c., by Goold Brown,&mdash;that it is the
fulfilment of a design formed upwards of a quarter of a century
since,&mdash;one feels pained at being merely enabled to announce that it is
a work obviously the fruit of much reflection on the part of its author,
and as obviously deserving of the attention of all whose duty it is to
discover the most advantageous system of inculcating the rules of
English Grammar.</p>

<p>We understand that several very important publications will shortly be
issued from the Oxford University Press. We may first mention the <i>Fasti
Catholici</i>, or <i>Universal Chronology</i>, by the Rev. Edward Greswell,
author of the <i>Harmony of the Gospels</i>, <i>the Parables</i>, &amp;c. It is stated
that the present work, which contains the result of the indefatigable
labour and research of the Editor for several years, is a still more
learned and elaborate production than any of his previous publications.
Another, which will excite great attention, is a <i>Catalogue of the
Manuscripts contained in the Libraries of the Twenty-four Colleges and
Halls of the University of Oxford</i>, which has been prepared by the Rev.
Henry Octavius Coxe, ore of the sub-librarians of the Bodleian Library,
editor of <i>Roger of Wendover's Chronicle</i>, and of Lewis's <i>Collection of
Forms of Bidding Prayer</i>, from the manuscript in the Bodleian Library.
And, lastly, we may mention a reprint of Bishop Burnet's <i>Lives of the
Dukes of Hamilton</i>, which is usually considered as a supplement to
Spottiswoode's <i>History of the Church of Scotland</i>.</p>
